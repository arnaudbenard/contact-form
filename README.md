# contact-form

After a conversion with @daralthus, I wanted to experiment with Iron Worker and see if it was possible to build a free contact form.
Solutions like https://formspree.io/ exist but I am a developer and decided to rebuild the wheel!

## How it works

The backend is handled by Iron Worker, I will add a blogpost explaining everything soon.

## Upload code

```
iron_worker upload contact_form
```
